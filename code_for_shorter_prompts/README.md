## The process to obtain the shorter prompts has undergone two distinct phases:

1. Initially, a function designed to short the original prompt is executed, with the corresponding code located in (shorter_prompt.py).
   
2. In order to facilitate the organization of the results, the outputs generated by this code are saved in (short_benchmark_humaneval.json).
   
3. To fulfill the criteria set for this experiment purpose, I utilized the short_benchmark_humaneval.json output and implemented further modifications.
   One of them was the conversion from JSON format to Hugging Face format.
   The associated code is available in (final_changes.py).
