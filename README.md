## Note:
The evaluation methodology reveals a certain degree of uniformity among the various prompt variations. Minor modifications exist within the commands utilized to generate the coding solutions and subsequently evaluate them. 
These modifications pertain to their respective directories. For clarity, each directory contains a README.md file wherein the procedural steps I undertook to complete the entire process are detailed. 
Within the GPU environment, all coding solutions derived from the evaluated coding problems, along with their corresponding results from the evaluation process, are accessible. 
The directory and file names are kept consistent with the labels provided in this document. Moreover, the newly developed dataset, originating from the prompt variations, are published on my Huggingface repository.
